# Model Notes


This a model from the article:  
**Parasympathetic modulation of sinoatrial node pacemaker activity in rabbit heart: a unifying model.**   
Demir SS, Clark JW, Giles WR. _Am J Physiol_ 1999 Jun;276(6 Pt 2):H2221-44

**Abstract:**   
We have extended our compartmental model [Am. J. Physiol. 266 (Cell Physiol.
35): C832-C852, 1994] of the single rabbit sinoatrial node (SAN) cell so that
it can simulate cellular responses to bath applications of ACh and
isoprenaline as well as the effects of neuronally released ACh. The model
employs three different types of muscarinic receptors to explain the variety
of responses observed in mammalian cardiac pacemaking cells subjected to vagal
stimulation. The response of greatest interest is the ACh-sensitive change in
cycle length that is not accompanied by a change in action potential duration
or repolarization or hyperpolarization of the maximum diastolic potential. In
this case, an ACh-sensitive K+ current is not involved. Membrane
hyperpolarization occurs in response to much higher levels of vagal
stimulation, and this response is also mimicked by the model. Here, an ACh-
sensitive K+ current is involved. The well-known phase-resetting response of
the SAN cell to single and periodically applied vagal bursts of impulses is
also simulated in the presence and absence of the beta-agonist isoprenaline.
Finally, the responses of the SAN cell to longer continuous trains of periodic
vagal stimulation are simulated, and this can result in the complete cessation
of pacemaking. Therefore, this model is 1) applicable over the full range of
intensity and pattern of vagal input and 2) can offer biophysically based
explanations for many of the phenomena associated with the autonomic control
of cardiac pacemaking.
